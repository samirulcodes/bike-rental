        <h2>Failing to learn the Basic Aspects of Riding a motorcycle</h2>
        <p>It's possible that a new rider might be well aware of the basic techniques of riding a bike, its also possible that you might have learned about bike control and bike riding in control situations.  But the possibilities and chances that the road brings In are pretty different than the ones you might have trained for. Being unable to feather the clutch, and use the throttle and clutch correctly, can lead you into big trouble.  The web is full of videos of novice riders failing to understand the power of the vehicle; due to the failure of stalling the bike, they often rev up the engine too high, and while dumping the clutch, the bike launches itself into a full-on lurch.
